            <p>Tyrion Lannister is the son of Tywin Lannister and Joanna Lannister. He has played one of the major roles in Game of Thrones series since the very first season. Given that Tyrion is a dwarf, he was always a victim of persecution, especially from his family. Tyrion, or "The Halfman" as they unformally call him, is highly educated in the arts of politics and strategy. He has travelled all around the world and was always protected by his brother, Jaime Lannister.
            </p>
            <p>Some of his most famous scenes included leading the defence in King's Landing at the battle of Blackwater, surviving the trial by combat twice: once at the Eyrie and a second time at King's Landing. He was blamed to kill his nephew although he had nothing to do with it. His best friends were his squire Podrick Payne and Varys, one of the most influential politicians in all westeros</p>
