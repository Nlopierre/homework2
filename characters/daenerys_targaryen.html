            <p>Daenerys Targaryen is the last survivor of the House Targaryen. She is the daughter of Aerys II Targaryen, also known as the "Mad King". Since the beginning of the series, it was clear that her role was going to be important as it has been until the day. Daenerys, or Dany, was raised by several lords in the eastern lands the world. Her brother traded her with Khal Drogo, the leader of the Dothraki, in exchange for an army. After getting married to Khal Drogo, Dany has found a way to raise to power in important cities across the Eastern emisphere, always with her mind set on Westeros.</p>
            <p>Some of her most famous scenes included surviving her own attempt to suicide in fire and giving birth to three dragons, Freeing the slaves of Astapor and ambushing the enemy who was attacking her own city of Meereen. Daenerys is considered the the Khaleesi or Queen of the Dothraki and the mother of the three last dragons in all the world.</p>
