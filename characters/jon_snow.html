            <h2> Description</h2>
            <p>Jon Snow was believed to be the bastard son of Ned Stark. He slowly became one of the most iconic and important characters of all the series. Catelyn Stark was never able to nuture him as her own son since he was the living evidence that her husband had been unloyal to her. "The White Wolf", as the northeners used to call him, is a selfless honorable man and a highly recognized member of the Night's Watch. He was loved by his half-siblings and later in the series his true origins are revealed.
            </p>
            <p>Some of his most famous scenes included leading the defence of The Wall against the wildlings, fighting the White Walkers at Hardhome and taking back his home: Winterfell. Jon Snow only loved a wildling named Ygritte, who was killed by a man of the Night's Watch during the assault of The Wall.</p>
